# AgileFabric git tests

This repository uses git-flow as its branching strategy.
The following subtitles represent branches. Each of them contains an exercice.
Unless it is specified, there is no need to push your changes. You work locally.

## feature/EX-1 | committed secret
In branch feature/EX-1, a developper committed a secret value. Please remove the last commit from this branch.

## feature/EX-2 and feature/EX-2-old | retrieve code from another branch
A developper started some work in branch feature/EX-2-old. Please retrieve the code (and comment) and put it in the real branch feature/EX-2.

## feature/EX-3 | change history
A developper worked on branch feature/EX-3 for quite some time, hence the numerous commits.
Please rewrite the history so that we have only one commit in the branch.
Keep the first commit comment.

## feature/EX-4 | update branch with latest develop state
A developper started branch feature/EX-4 from a previous state of develop.
Please update this branch with the latest state of develop.
